This is an ai toolbox built by Nextjs. This project's backend interface is deployed on cloudflare worker. You can find the simple worker source code [here](https://github.com/chenyuan-new/ai-toolbox-worker)


## Getting Started

First, run the development server in both Nextjs and worker repo:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
You should **copy** the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env.local` and fill in the missing settings.
